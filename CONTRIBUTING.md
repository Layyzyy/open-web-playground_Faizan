Always create a new branch for your changes. This keeps your work organized and makes it easier to manage multiple contributions.

### Create and Switch to a New Branch

```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

**Branch Naming Conventions:**
- Use descriptive names that reflect the purpose of your changes
- Use kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens)
- Examples:
  - `fix-navigation-bug`
  - `add-dark-mode-feature`
  - `update-readme-documentation`
  - `improve-accessibility`

## ‚úçÔ∏è Commit Message Conventions

Good commit messages help maintain a clear project history. Follow these guidelines:

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>: <short description>

<optional detailed description>

<optional footer>
```

### Commit Types

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code refactoring without changing functionality
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks, dependency updates, etc.

### Examples

```bash
# Good commit messages
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication system"
git commit -m "fix: resolve navigation menu overflow on mobile"
git commit -m "docs: update installation instructions in README"
git commit -m "style: format code according to project style guide"

# Bad commit messages (avoid these)
git commit -m "fixed stuff"
git commit -m "updates"
git commit -m "asdfgh"
```

### Best Practices

- Use the imperative mood ("add feature" not "added feature")
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Capitalize the first letter
- Don't end with a period
- Provide context in the detailed description if needed
